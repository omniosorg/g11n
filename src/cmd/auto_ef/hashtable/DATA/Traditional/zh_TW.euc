#
# TRANSLATION_NOTE -- Beginning of USAGE message
# 	The following messages are the usage messages for the ld command.
#	Tab characters (\t) are used to align the messages.
#
#	Each usage message starts with \t, and if the message has more than one
#		line, the following messages are aligned by 3 tab characters.
#		When you see \n\t\t\t, the first \n is used to change the line,
#		and following 3 tab characters are used to align the line.
#
#	Each usage message option is surrounded by [ and ].  Then the
#	description of the option follows. The descriptions should be aligned,
#	so tab characters are padded as needed after the closing bracket ].
#
#	How to align the messages are up to the translators and the
#	localization engineers.
#
#	In C locale, the first 3 messages would look like the following:
#
#	usage: ld [-6:abc:.....] file(s)
#        	[-a]            create an absolute file
#        	[-b]            do not do special PIC relocations in a.out
